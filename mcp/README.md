# MCP Client Database Interface

Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for the client database, enabling AI-powered interactions with client data.

## Overview

This implementation uses the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) to provide a standardized way for LLMs to interact with our client database. It enables natural language queries and AI-assisted data exploration.

## Components

### Server
- Handles client data requests
- Provides context for LLM interactions
- Manages database connections
- Implements MCP protocol handlers

### Client
- Connects to MCP server
- Sends structured queries
- Handles responses
- Provides example usage

## Usage

### Running the Server

---
python -m mcp.server
---

### Using the Client

---
from mcp.client import ClientDatabaseClient

client = ClientDatabaseClient()

# Get client info
result = client.get_client(230126)

# Search clients
results = client.search_clients(city="Seattle", gender="F")
---

## MCP Integration

This implementation follows the MCP specification for:
- Message handling
- Context management
- Resource exposure
- Tool integration

## Dependencies

- mcp: Model Context Protocol SDK
- mysql-connector-python: Database connectivity
- python-dotenv: Environment configuration
- json: Data serialization

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Natural language query support
- [ ] LLM-powered data analysis
- [ ] Context-aware responses
- [ ] Advanced sampling capabilities
- [ ] Integration with Claude and other LLMs
- [ ] Query templating system
- [ ] Response formatting options

## Notes

This implementation is designed to work with large language models and can be extended to support natural language queries. The current version provides basic client data access, with plans to add more sophisticated AI-powered features in future updates.
